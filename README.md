[ what i'm planning to be learning in cp, roadmap you can say]

--------------------------------------------------------

0 = have to finish (mostly just empty)
1 = in the middle
✅ = finished entirely
{} = personal reference
() = extra info

-------------------------------------------------------------

- starting

- [] time complexity analysis
- [] linear search/circular array representation
- [1] palindrome and other numbers, for basic number problems
- [] hashing problems (frequency counting)
- [] prefix sum problems (1d, 2d)
- [] sliding window technique {better understanding needed}

---------------------------------------------------------------

- basics of number theory

- [] gcd of two numbers in logarithmic time (euclidean and extended euclidean algorithm)
- [] linear diphantine equation
- [] checking prime in sqrt of n complexity
- [] sieve of eratothenes
- [] euler totent function
- [] fermat little theorum 

-- more advanced

- [] finding x^n in log[n]
- [] modular arithmetic
- [] modular inverse of a number
- [] modular exponentiation
- [] chinese remainder theorem (I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS HEPL)
- [] finding nCr/nPr for queries (constant time)
- [] inclusion exclusion principle (combinatorics problem)

-------------------------------------------------------------

- general 

- [] sorting algorithms (bubble, selection, insertion)
- [] solve a heck a ton of problems on these to get familiar and because.. you have nothing to do? yeah that works
- [] problems related to two pointer approach 
- [] bit manipulation (lshift, rshift, xor, or, and, set bit, msb etc)
- [] power set of given array or string using bit
- [] num of subarrays with xor as zero (not algorithm) (interesting problem tho)
- [] problems related to greedy algorithm (bro what are these algorithm names)
- [] kadane's algorithm
- [] learn recursion

-------------------------------------------------------------

- after you learn recursion, HERE'S MORE STUFF TO DO EHEHEHEHEHHE

- [] in the middle algorithm, solve problems related to it
- [] divide and conquer problems (codeforces pretty nice for this apparently)
- [] next greater element and next smaller element using stack
- [] MORE problems related to parenthesis
- [] largest rectangular area in a histogram 
- [] solve MORE problems related with heap priority queue

-------------------------------------------------------------

- [] rolling hash functions on strings
- [] rabin karp algo
- [] prefix function
- [] kmp algo
- [] z-function
- [] manchers' algorithm

-------------------------------------------------------------

it is 15/10/2024 right now

I AM NEVER FINISHING THIS :sob:
